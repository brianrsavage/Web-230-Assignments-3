WEB-230 | How PHP Works – Server Side Scripting – Assignment

  1. The server-side is known as the back-end and the client-side is known as the front-end. What is being viewed by the
     browser is happening on the client-side whereas the processing of data to be shown on the browser is happening on the
     server-side. 
     
  2. Programming languages like HTML need to be compiled before running but scripting languages like PHP do not need
     compilation. Scripting languages are able to run inside of other programs as opposed to programming which can not.
     
  3. PHP is a scripting language that runs in the background of websites. PHP delivers customized responses to the
     client.
     
  4. The client makes a request to the browser or website such as a log-in. The server clarifies the user information and 
     returns the appropiate data back to the client. 
     
  5. The differences between post types are what you the client are seeing. Depending on the kind of request you make to the 
     server, that's the result you get back.
